  <h3>This was a fun hike I took with my partner at the San Pablo Dam Road.

  <h3>This was another fun hike that my bestfriend Terrence took me to in San Ramon.
         <br>The hike was so short that we made it to the peak within 10 minutes. It wasn't so much of an incline hike, as it was climbing up rocks.    </br>
